## Why?
- To clarify. This is not about me getting my perms removed. I never asked or applied for staff and even left after I got them back
- The context is him calling me dumb and wrong about a topic a long time ago which I was right about. Which led to me stopping on working on this menu.
- There was a issue about users crashing when injecting the menu which he blamed me on multiple times. It was because runtime library and users having a unsupported version installed
- So a long time later I wrote "im not working on this menu anymore" in a chat which he became mad about and removed my perms
- So since he removed my perms I removed him from the org and it would have ended there if he didnt spread all these lies
- Then I gave him a option making a annoucement which says he lied about me with all the things he lied about but he said "Go ahead leaked it.  Like it wasn't leaked before e"
- So here it is

## Blaspheme in Person
- Keep your distance from this guy. He blasphemes about everyone, including me.
- I had a guy he was blaspheming about telling me that he was blaspheming about me
- Also said stuff about known people which I dont want to drag in here (yet) :)

# Lies

I jokingly removed his role for a minute. 
- Downplay to make it seem like a joke
- It was 1 hour and 22 after I dmed him

Then bro crashed out
- I called him mad
- He started mocking me
- I left LX and removed him from org
- I started mocking him
  
he kicked me from my own shit
- I created the org and removed him from it
  
"Dont bite the hand that was feeding you"
- All he did was give me a updated big base 3 years ago and couldnt even help with basic questions ("calling natives in present crashes because script vm is slow" ü§°)
- I made like +100 commits which made LX what it is rn. You can see them right here :) (note my older commits were mostly skidded since I was learning C++ at that time)
  
I took him when he didnt have jack shit.
- I was learning C++ and this retard randomly gave me staff when I said send noodles (ogs remember) without me even asking.
- He had issues fixing his shit menu.
- He tried asking VSussy for help but they couldnt fix it.
- Added me to LX and ofcouse the guy who didnt have jackshit fixed his shit menu
